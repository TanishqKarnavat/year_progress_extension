# Year Progress – Chrome New Tab Extension

A minimal Chrome extension that replaces the New Tab page and shows how much of the current year has already passed.

It’s designed to be quiet, not flashy — a small reminder you see before you drift into wasting time.

## Why this exists
Most new tabs lead to distractions.
This one pauses you for a second and shows a simple fact:

Time is moving, whether you notice it or not.

No quotes. No productivity hacks. Just a number.

## Features
- Real-time year progress calculation
- Clean, distraction-free UI
- Works offline
- No permissions required
- No tracking, no noise

## How to use
1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select this folder

## Tech
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Note
This extension doesn’t try to motivate you.
It just makes time visible — what you do with that is up to you.
